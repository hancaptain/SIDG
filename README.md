SIDG
====

spatial interpolation based on differential geometry

In order to quickly implement SIDG, a new tool named algebraic modeling languages (AMLs) is introduced. AMLs is a computer-readable language for describing objective functions and constraints in the kind of algebraic notation. AMLs allow non-specialists to easily formulate and solve mathematical programming models, avoiding the need for a deep understanding of the underlying algorithmic technologies. Python Optimization Modeling Objects (Pyomo) software is an open-source AML developed and maintained by Sandia National Laboratories, it provide a platform for expressing optimization models that supports the central ideas of modern AMLs within a framework that promotes flexibility, extensibility, portability, maintainability and coding efficiency.
